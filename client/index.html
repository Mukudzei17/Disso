        PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET
        <br>
        (1) What is this study about?<br><br>
        You are invited to take part in a research study I am conducting as part of a postgraduate study for my Cybersecurity course. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors contributing to poor password hygiene among users as well as assessing the impact of stringent security rules on users’ password fatigue. Furthermore, I aim to compare password hygiene practices between different user groups.<br><br>
        <br>
        This Participant Information Sheet tells you about the research study. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the study. Please read this sheet carefully and ask questions about anything that you don’t understand or want to know more about.  
        <br>
        Participation in this research study is voluntary. By giving consent to take part in this study you are telling us that you:
        <br><br>
        	Understand what you have read.<br>
        	Agree to take part in the research study as outlined below.<br>
        	Agree to the use of your personal information as described.<br>
        	You have received a copy of this Participant Information Sheet to keep.<br>
        <br>
        (2) Who is running the study?<br><br>
        The study is being carried out by the following student - Mr Mukudzei Chauruka - who is conducting this study as the basis for the degree of MSc Cybersecurity at the University of East Anglia.
        This will take place under the supervision of Miss Sally Earl and Miss Debbie Taylor.
        <br><br>
        
        
        
        (3) What will the study involve for me?<br><br>
        It would simply require you to perform the following steps:<br><br>
        1.	Create an account on the webpage I have created by inputting a username and password (It is important that you do not use a password you curently use for any existing accounts). 
        <br><br>
        2.	Log into said account.
        <br><br>
        3. Fill out a survey about your password practises. 
        <br>
        Once participants have created their accounts and filled out the survey, I will observe whether certain security measures lead to a higher cognitive load on a user and whether there is a correlation between a particular group and their password practises. 
        <br><br>
        
        
        
        You will not have the opportunity to review information generated about you prior to publication.
        <br><br>
        (4)	How much of my time will the study take?<br><br>
        5 - 10 minutes<br><br>
        
        (5) Do I have to be in the study? Can I withdraw from the study once I have started?<br><br>
        Being in this study is completely voluntary and you do not have to take part. <br>
        Your decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relationship with the researchers or anyone else at the University of East Anglia  now or in the future. 
        <br>
        If you decide to take part in the study, you can withdraw your consent at any point before you submit the results of your first questionnaire.
        <br>
        (6) What are the consequences if I withdraw from the study?<br><br> 
        If you decide to take part in the study and then change your mind, you are free to withdraw at any time before you have submitted the questionnaire. Once you have submitted it, your responses can only be withdrawn by contacting the researcher via the information provided. 
        <br>
        (7)	 Are there any risks or costs associated with being in the study?<br><br>
        Aside from giving up your time, we do not expect that there will be any risks or costs associated with taking part in this study.
        <br>
        (8) Are there any benefits associated with being in the study?<br><br>
        You will benefit from learning about your own password behaviours and the risks assocciated with them.<br><br>
        The broader community will benefit from the study because security designers will be encouraged to communicate and collaborate with users in the future.
        <br><br>
        (9) What will happen to information provided by me and data collected during the study?<br><br>
        The information you provide will be analysed by myself and then added to my dissertation project but will remain anonymous.<br>
        <br><br>
        Your personal data and information will only be used as outlined in this Participant Information Sheet, unless you consent otherwise.

        <br><br>
        The information you provide will be stored securely and your identity will be kept strictly confidential, except as required by law. Study findings will be used for the purposes of my dissertation and may also be used for other scholarly and educational purposes such as research publications and in teaching. Although every effort will be made to protect your identity, there is a risk that you might be identifiable due to the nature of the study and/or results if you decide to participate in this study. Where the study findings are solely used for the dissertation, the data will be destroyed following the examination of the dissertation.

        <p2> >The most common password is still "123456". It would take a hacker less than a second to crack this password!
            <br><br>
            >If your password is "password", it's one of the top 10 most common passwords and can be guessed almost instantly by hackers.
            <br><br>
            >A 12-character password with numbers, symbols, and mixed-case letters would take about 34,000 years to crack using current technology.
            <br><br>
            >If over 80% of hacking-related breaches are linked to weak or reused passwords. This makes it crucial to use different passwords for each of your accounts.
            <br><br>
            >A random passphrase like "SunsetsAreB3autiful!" is both easy to remember and difficult to crack, making it a more secure option than a simple password.
            <br><br>
            >While biometric authentication is becoming more popular, it's still recommended to pair it with a strong password for maximum security.
            <br><br>
            >If you use the same password for all your accounts, you're significantly increasing the risk of multiple accounts being compromised if one password is leaked.
            <br><br>
            >Passwords that are at least 15 characters long are much more secure and less likely to be cracked by brute-force attacks.
            <br><br>
            >Adding just one extra character to your password can make it up to 85 times more secure. The longer the password, the exponentially harder it becomes to crack.
            <br><br>
            >The average person has 100 passwords. Using a password manager can help you create and remember unique, strong passwords for each account.
            <br><br>
            >63% of confirmed data breaches leverage a weak, default, or stolen password.
            <br><br>
            >Changing just one letter to a symbol in your password (e.g., "e" to "3") can make it 1,000 times harder to crack!</p2>
